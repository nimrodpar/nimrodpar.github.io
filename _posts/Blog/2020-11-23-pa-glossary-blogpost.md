I created a [program analysis glossary](https://github.com/nimrodpar/ProgramAnalysisGlossary) due to a recent exploration experience, where I realized there are
so many types of analyses and definitions and found it hard to keep up.

The glossary is example-oriented, and almost all of the terms are explained using code and an analysis result on the code for that type of analysis. You will find an explanation (if needed) in the comments section.

The slides are fairly new and may very well contain mistakes! Please report them via issues. You are also welcome to ask questions, point out gaps and either suggest or request additions. I will try my best to address issues ASAP.

Cheers üçª
