**Abstract**: _The ability to record and replay program executions
               with low overhead enables many applications, such
               as reverse-execution debugging, debugging of hard to reproduce test failures,
               and "black box" forensic analysis of failures in deployed systems. Existing record-and-replay
               approaches limit deployability by recording an entire virtual machine
               (heavyweight), modifying the OS kernel (adding deployment and maintenance costs),
               requiring pervasive code instrumentation (imposing significant performance and
               complexity overhead), or modifying compilers and runtime systems (limiting generality).
               We investigated whether it is possible to build a practical record-and-replay
               system avoiding all these issues.
               The answer turns out to be yes â€” if the CPU and operating system meet certain non-obvious
               constraints. Fortunately modern Intel CPUs, Linux kernels and user-space
               frameworks do meet these constraints, although this has
               only become true recently. With some novel optimizations, our system RR records
               and replays real-world low parallelism workloads with low overhead, with an entirely
               user-space implementation, using stock hardware, compilers, runtimes and operating systems.
               RR forms the basis of an open-source reverse-execution debugger seeing significant use in
               practice. We present the design and implementation of RR, describe its performance on a
               variety of workloads, and identify constraints on hardware
               and operating system design required to support our approach._
