**Abstract**: _We address the problem of finding similar procedures in
               stripped binaries. We present a new statistical approach for
               measuring the similarity between two procedures. Our notion of similarity allows us to find similar code even when
               it has been compiled using different compilers, or has been
               modified. The main idea is to use similarity by composition:
               decompose the code into smaller comparable fragments, define semantic similarity between fragments, and use statistical reasoning to lift fragment similarity into similarity
               between procedures. We have implemented our approach
               in a tool called Esh, and applied it to find various prominent vulnerabilities across compilers and versions, including
               Heartbleed, Shellshock and Venom. We show that Esh produces high accuracy results, with few to no false positives
               â€“ a crucial factor in the scenario of vulnerability search in
               stripped binaries._
